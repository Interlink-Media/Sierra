# Before you change anything here:
#
# In the overwhelming majority of cases, changing stuff here will break things.
# It is recommended not to change anything here unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# When you experience false positives, report them to us, and we will fix them.
# Before changing anything, please check the Sierra console output for any warnings or instructions.
# If you have any questions, contact us on discord.

# To make it difficult for those who intend to harm your server, you should hide the plugin version from the public.
# This way, they won't be able to write version-specific crash exploits.
# We recommend keeping this setting enabled
hide-version: true

# The Packet Spam Checks are a collection of frequency and tick-based checks that examine incoming packets
# for a specific frequency or certain tick variations. These checks have been thoroughly tested for any false
# kicks and can therefore remain active without any restrictions. Please only disable them on direct instruction
# from the support team, as they provide a significant fundamental protection against malicious attacks.
prevent-packet-spam: true

# This is the core of our system. This is the check that examines all incoming and outgoing packets for
# incorrect values, faulty NBT tags, or protocol variations. Under no circumstances should this check be deactivated,
# as it performs the majority of the work by far. This check operates incredibly precisely. If there are any issues
# with it, please contact our Discord team immediately, so that they can analyze and resolve the problem
prevent-invalid-packet: true

# This is a collection of crashers that are typically only used on creative servers. However, since these checks
# are well-developed, they can always remain active. They do not affect regular gameplay and can only provide
# additional protection. We strongly recommend never disabling this check
prevent-creative-crasher: true

# This is a check that not everyone will need. There are a number of plugins that have poorly developed parts of their
# code, resulting in lag with certain commands. Therefore, we have developed a check that intercepts and blocks these
# commands before they reach the server. Below, you will find a list provided by us in the configuration, which should
# already include most of the problematic commands. You can add or remove commands as needed
block-disallowed-commands: true

# This is a very sensitive and often error-prone check. It is relatively similar to a speed/fly check from an
# anti-cheat system. If there is an anti-cheat on the server that provides a certain baseline, this check can
# usually be deactivated. Examples of such anti-cheats include Polar, Intave, or Grim. However, if you still
# have this check enabled and encounter issues, please report them to us immediately on Discord
prevent-invalid-move: true

# This is a way to additionally prevent movement-based cheats. This check should be disabled if there's a reliable
# anti-cheat system like Polar or Intave on the server. This check can only kick in as a last resort, so it can be
# activated. If too many players are being kicked, please report it and disable the check
prevent-timer-cheats: true

# This is a simple NBT length check that simply verifies that the NBT tag does not exceed a certain limit.
# This check will eliminate many cheap crashers and already stop a large number of people.
# If there are any issues with the check, please report them on Discord and I will adjust the limit accordingly.
generic-nbt-limit: true

# This is also a crucial core element of our system, as most crashers operate with books and NBT data.
# This check must never be deactivated, as it also constitutes a very significant part of our security promise.
# This check operates very precisely. If you experience any issues with it, please contact us immediately on Discord.
# We can then address and resolve the problem promptly.
prevent-book-crasher: true

# This is a way to disable books and all associated crashers. This check should be activated on all servers where
# players do not have access to books. It is important to note that enabling this check is by no means a reason to
# deactivate the other checks. Prevention is always a sensible measure
disable-books-completely: false

# This is an important setting for both Creative and regular servers. If you have a plugin on the server that allows
# you to get enchantments larger than those specified by Minecraft Vanilla, you need to adjust this value. If you want
# to completely deactivate this check, simply enter -1. However, we do not recommend it.
# We would suggest adjusting the value as needed
max-enchantment-level: 5

# Should we skip negative enchantments. (Not recommended)
allow-negative-enchantments: false

# Here you can choose between two punishment options.
#
# HARD: This one is capable of banning players as well as kicking them.
#       With this setting, the punish command also takes effect. This is also the default setting.
# LIGHT: This option is not capable of banning a player.
#        This option only kicks and does not ban players.
internal-punishment-config: "HARD"

# You can choose between vanilla max and min attribute values or use Sierra`s max and min values
use-vanilla-attribute-mapping: true

# This is the command by which the Sierra punish a player when it is 99.99% certain
# that a player attempted to crash the server
punish-command: "ban {username} Crashing"

# Should we kick out the players experiencing errors while processing packets?
# This option can be safely left activated, as such errors occur only in 99.99% of
# cases with crashers, since the API is very mature
kick-on-packet-exception: true

# Should sierra block redstone crash loops?
block-redstone-loops: true

# Default value. Only increase / decrease in case of crashes or issues!
# See console for more details and warnings
redstone-tick-limit: 60

# Should we log any action of sierra in console? Recommended in case of errors!
log-violation-to-console: true

# Should we block future connections after a player got punished? Recommended
block-connections-after-ban: true

skip-negative-experience-check: false # Not recommended
